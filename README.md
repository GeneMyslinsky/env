# the purpose of this repo is to save all the rice that I've applied to my customizations so that eventually I can pull them instantly on any machine.
# feel free to copy use, tweak and offer me suggestions.

# I mainly use Arch WSL on Windows as I work professionally on C# and Java products in the FinTech space and Excel *(with Powerquery)* is still one of the most important tools in my arsenal.
